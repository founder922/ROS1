# Embodied Cognition in Robotics (ROS1)

Implementation of neural field dynamics and perceptual binding for real-robot navigation.

Official implementation accompanying the paper:

"Embodied Cognition in Robotics via Neural Field Dynamics and Perceptual Binding"
## Overview

This repository contains the ROS1 implementation of a neural-field-based navigation framework inspired by embodied cognition principles.

The system integrates:

- Neural field dynamics
- Perceptual binding
- Real-time LiDAR processing
- Field-based motor control

Tested on TurtleBot3 Burger platform.
